With everything we do online, there's a vast amount of sensitive information at risk: email addresses, passwords, phone numbers, and much more.

With the Information Security Certification, you'll build a secure web app with HelmetJS to learn the fundamentals of protecting people's information online.

You'll also build a TCP client, and an Nmap and port scanner in Python. This will help you learn the basics of penetration testing — an important component of good information security.

### [Information Security with HelmetJS](./information-security-with-helmetjs/README.md)

This programming course focuses on HelmetJS, a type of middleware for Express-based applications that automatically sets HTTP headers. This way it can prevent sensitive information from unintentionally being passed between the server and client.

Completing the courses below will help you understand how to protect your website from malicious behavior.

### [Python for Penetration Testing](./python-for-penetration-testing/README.md)

These video courses teach you penetration testing with Python. Also known as a pen test, penetration testing is a simulated attack against a system to check for vulnerabilities.

In this course, you'll learn about sockets, create a TCP server and client, build an Nmap scanner, and other tools and techniques that pen testers use daily.

### [Information Security Projects](./information-security-projects/README.md)

Now it’s time to put your new information security skills to work. These projects will give you a chance to apply the infosec skills, principles, and concepts you've learned.

When you are done, you will have plenty of information security projects under your belt, along with a certification that you can show off to friends, family, and employers.
