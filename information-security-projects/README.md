With everything we do online, there's a vast amount of sensitive information at risk: email addresses, passwords, phone numbers, and much more.

With the Information Security Certification, you'll build a secure web app with HelmetJS to learn the fundamentals of protecting people's information online.

You'll also build a TCP client, and an Nmap and port scanner in Python. This will help you learn the basics of penetration testing — an important component of good information security.

### [Information Security with HelmetJS](./data-visualization-with-d3/README.md)

D3, or D3.js, stands for Data Driven Documents. It's a JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations in the browser.

D3 is built to work with common web standards – namely HTML, CSS, and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).

D3 supports many different kinds of input data formats. Then, using its powerful built-in methods, you can transform those data into different charts, graphs, and maps.

In the Data Visualization with D3 courses, you'll learn how to work with data to create different charts, graphs, hover elements, and other ingredients to create dynamic and attractive data visualizations.

### [Python for Penetration Testing](./json-apis-and-ajax/README.md)

Similar to how UIs help people use programs, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) help programs interact with other programs. APIs are tools that computers use to communicate with one another, in part to send and receive data.

Programmers often use AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) when working with APIs. AJAX refers to a group of technologies that make asynchronous requests to a server to transfer data, then load any returned data into the page. And the data transferred between the browser and server is often in a format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

This course will teach you the basics about working with APIs and different AJAX technologies in the browser.

### [Information Security Projects](./data-visualization-projects/README.md)

Now that you learned how to work with D3, APIs, and AJAX technologies, put your skills to the test with these 5 Data Visualization projects.

In these projects, you'll need to fetch data and parse a dataset, then use D3 to create different data visualizations. Finish them all to earn your Data Visualization certification.
